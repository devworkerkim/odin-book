# Odin-Book | The Odin Project

This is the repo for the Odin-Book project in the NodeJS course of The Odin Project.  The objective of the project is to recreate the Facebook website.  The website needs to have the basic functionality of Facebook such as user accounts, posting, and friending users.  A basic news feed needs to be included as well as options to comment and like posts.
